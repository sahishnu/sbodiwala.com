        <h1>Learn about Wine!</h1>
        	<p class="lead">Our group, SCLAD, has decided to enlighten users on the many different styles and types of wine around the world. Many wines around the world come from different cultures and traditions. Some are even used during special occasions while others are for traditional consumption. While there are many wine experts out there, thereâ€™s a fair amount of people who enjoy wine, but also want to learn and know more about the culture and tradition of wine.</p>
			
			<p class="lead">For our project, we have decided to focus our digital library on wine, the drink of the gods. The collection will not be limited to any specific type of wine, but will sample different regions, price ranges, styles, and tastes. The database is intended to be used by wide span of people, from wine novices to wine snobs (all at least 21 years of age). They might use our collection to browse through a variety of wine, maybe trying to find a bottle that they've never tasted or looking to find good wine at a reasonable price. With the wines they find in our library, consumers can also know if it is offered in a store nearby. With this digital library, users can now have the information of a wine intellectual all on a convenient and user friendly website.</p>

          	<p>Our evaluation will allow SCLAD to find design flaws and issues where user design can be better implemented for a better overall experience for the user. We will always remember that the user is the most important part and is the center of our design.</p>
