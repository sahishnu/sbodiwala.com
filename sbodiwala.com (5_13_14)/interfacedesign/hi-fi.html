    <h3>Design Changes Made</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        When going from the lo-fi prototype to the hi-fi, we decided to make a few design and functionality changes. To start, we changes the way that users will browse through wines. In the original lo-fi design, there were tabs on the navigation bar that included type, price, rating etc. With the new design, we switched to a simpler browse tab. Within this tab users will be able to browse through wines by same categories we originally intended, but in a more organized manner. We also decided to do away with the recently viewed side-bar. This was meant to show the user what wines they previously looked at while they are on the site. We decided that since the user will probably not be on the site for extended periods of time, but instead will just find a wine they like and leave the site, this feature was not necessary. If on the other hand we had the users signing up and creating a login, this would be a useful feature in which they could go back and view the wines they looked at last time, but this is not the case. We changes our category of “Wines under 20$” to ten dollars because we found that the majority of our wines were between the prices of 10 and 20 dollars. We found that this category made more sense given the circumstances. Other than these changes, we kept the original look and feel of the lo-fi prototype, giving it a cleaner and more functional design.

    <h3>Typical Task Flow</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        In a typical task flow for our new design, the user would start by visiting our home page. If the user was a younger and less knowledgeable about wine, we expect them to look straight at the categories on the home page. They would browse through the categories of wines under $10, top 5 wines of the week, etc. If they do not find anything they would like within these categories, we expect them to click on the browse tab. Here they can find exactly what they want. If they want a wine with a high rating, or a certain country or type, it is right at their finger tips. For our other typical user, someone who has good background knowledge of wine, we expect a slightly different pattern. When they first come on to the home page, they will scan the categories because they automatically catch the eye. They will possibly look through the top wines of the year and of the week to see if anything sparks their interest. If they find nothing here, we expect them to go to the search bar. Since they have more knowledge, they will know some kind of aspect of the wine they are looking to find. Whether it be the country, a year or a type, they will be able to search it. Although browsing is our main feature and this is what we expect of the “typical user”, we made sure to have the search bar to account for the users whom don’t need to browse, but want to find a particular wine.

    <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <img src="images/home.png">
      <p class="lead">
        If you look on at the screenshot of the home page, you will see functions that include a search bar, categories that users can browse including wines of the year and week, and a navigation bar that allows you to go between the home page and the browsing page.
      </p>

    <h3>Browsing Page</h3>
      <img src="images/browse.png">
      <p class="lead">
        On the browsing page the same search and navigation functions are available. Also available is the ability to browse through the various categories. These categories are shown above and each one will bring you to a new page with a list of wines.

    <h3>Browsing/Search Example</h3>
      <img src="images/brosearch.png">
      <p class="lead">
        The screenshot above shows an example of what a page will look like after your search or browse through a category. A table shows in which will show all of the wines that fit within the particular category that was searched or browsed. You also have the option or searching or returning the home/browse pages here as well.
