    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p class="lead">In our previous task we created two personas and scenarios based on the split in our survey results.  Half of our users preferred searching and the other half preferred browsing selected categories to find what they wanted.  In our next step, we have created 2 distinct lo-fi prototypes based on the options of searching or browsing.</p>

    <!--Prototype 1 -->
    <div id="proto1" class="container">
      <h4>Paper Prototype 1 - Search First Approach</h4>

      </a>

      <p class="lead">
        Half of our survey respondents prefered searching over browsing, so this prototype illustrates a search centered design. The storyboard depicts a user typing “italy” into the search bar on the homepage, which then brings up a results list of wine from Italy. After viewing the results, the user decides that they want to refine their results some more and adds “white wine” to their search. The system then reformats the results list to feature only Italian white wines. The user then sees a wine they are interested in and looks at the full record to see more details about the product.

      <p class="lead">
        From our surveys we figured out that at least half of the users did not know a lot about wine and would prefer to browse through all types of wine rather than search for a particular one. This prototype gives different categories that the user can browse through to find he perfect wine. On the first step the user selects the category "top ten wines of the year". When the user does this they are directed to a new page which lists those top ten wines, thier price, the year and the type of wine it is. During this step they choose the Hartwell wine and click for more details. This brings up a page just about that specific wine. It shows all the details from the rating, to reviews, to the region it is from. Under the picture of the wine is a button where they can view more wines made my that particular winery. On the last step, the user clicks this button. Now a new page is brought up. This page lists all of the wines that are made by the Hartwell winery In which they can click on to view more details.

    <!--Lessons Learned -->
    <div class="container">
      <h4 class="lead">Lessons Learned</h4>
      <p class="lead">
        In order to create our prototypes we used the survey and task matrices created in the previous project. We decided to focus our designs on searching and browsing, two methods we found were preferred by our survey respondents. The first prototype makes use of a search based approach. Having a search focused design is beneficial because users are able to search using different variables to specify what they want, such as wine, year, or country. However, many of our users will probably be new users, which may be an issue for this type of design. Since wines can have complicated names and different years and makes, users could have a difficult time searching for types of wine, unless they know exactly what they want. Many users might feel turned away when they see the search bar, but do not know the exact wine they want.

      <p class="lead">
        The second prototype prominently features categories through which the users can browse. Many users who go to our website will be new users, and to accommodate their wants this prototype has specific topics of interest on the main page. This provides control over what users will be clicking on and could better aid in how we want to focus and promote certain wines. This prototype also includes visual representations to help the user. As George A. Miller hypothesized, users can only recall on average seven items, plus or minus two, so the recently viewed section will be extremely valuable for users who are browsing through scores of wines. With this feature, they will be able to refer back to the wines that they have chosen before. The downside to the second prototype is that it is overcrowded with options. This could be too overwhelming for people coming to our website. Although it is a benefit to have many selections for the user to choose from, they may want to look up a particular type of wine that is not presented within the categories. Many users are not going to search the whole page of the website to find what they want and they might leave if they cannot clearly see the search bar.
