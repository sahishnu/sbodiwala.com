          <p class="lead">Winestock is a digital library filled with great background and expertise information on wine. The digital library design is focused on users first, providing simple information about questions wine buyers want to know before purchasing the right bottle. In the following, you will see research done on wine buyers to find out all the right answers to questions about finding the right wine in order to design this digital library.</p>

          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Summary of Interview Results<br/></h3>
          <p class="lead">
          After deciding to focus our digital library on wine, we conducted a survey to discover the habits of our potential users. We interviewed them on their current wine searching methods and then questioned them about what attributes they would like to see in our system.</p>

          <p class="lead">Four participants filled out our questionnaire. All were between the ages of 21-30, with the majority being full-time students. Gender of the responders was split, two were male and the others were female. Their average claimed knowledge of wine falls around a 2 on a scale of 1-5, the higher the number signifying greater expertise. All responded that they do not do any research before purchasing a bottle of wine, though one participant wrote that they check the website Tastings.com after drinking a bottle to read the reviews and another mentioned choosing bottles they’ve already tried. The factors that influence their wine purchase are divided between taste and price.</p>

          <p class="lead">When asked how they would search for wine using online sources, most replied that they would use the search engine Google, using keywords like, “red wine,” “best sweet wine,” “cheap red wine,” and “wine reviews.” Additionally, Tastings.com was also mentioned as a reliable online source. For what kind of features they would like to see in a wine digital library, participants mentioned search features, selections of wine with pictures, wine pairings, ratings, and reviews. They were also asked if they preferred keyword searching or browsing. Results were split between searching and browsing.</p><hr class="featurette-divider">

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Tasks<br/></h3>
          <p class="lead">
          The primary users of our digital library are wine drinkers. We expect our users to have different knowledge levels about wine and fall on a range. The table below represents three levels of users that we believe will make use of our database. They will perform searching and browsing tasks that lead them to discover wine they might like or have an interest in drinking. They will also be interested in the different qualities of wine like type and taste.</p>

          <table class="table table-bordered" border="1" style="width:700px;">
            <tr>
              <td><b>Users</b></td>
              <td><b>Task 1</b></td>
              <td><b>Task 2</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Novice wine drinkers</td>
              <td>Browse through list of all wines</td>
              <td>Read reviews</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Intermediate wine drinkers</td>
              <td>Look up favored brand</td>
              <td>Check prices</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Expert wine drinkers</td>
              <td>Search for vintage</td>
              <td>Look for variety they haven't tried</td>
            </tr>
          </table><br/><br/>


          <p class="lead">Our database will contain information about wine that will help our potential users find a bottle agreeable to them. They will undertake searching and browsing most often, but will also carry out tasks that lead them towards a selection. The two task matrices below outlines the tasks performed by our representative users.</p>

          <table class="table table-bordered" border="1" style="width: 700px;">
            <tr>

            <tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Check vintage</td>
              <td>Sometimes</td>
              <td>Medium</td>
              <td>Users with wine experience will like to know the year the wine was produced</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Compare wine ratings</td>
              <td>Sometimes</td>
              <td>Medium</td>

          <p class="lead"><b>Persona 1:<br/>
          Name: Karen Leenig<br/>
          Age: 34<br/>
          Occupation: Financial Coordinator</b></p>

          <p class="lead">Karen is a finance coordinator at an assisted living company. She is a novice when it comes to computers, but can perform simple tasks such as using Microsoft Office and browsing the Internet. Karen is a frequent wine drinker; she and her husband have a glass each night with dinner. She likes to try a variety of wines and likes to know what she is drinking. She has a small wine cellar in her basement with about 100 bottles in it. Details about wine are very important to Karen and she wants to know as much as she can about a bottle before she buys it.</p><br/><br/>

          <p class="lead"><b>Persona 2:<br/>
          Name: Bryan Gillis<br/>
          Age: 22<br/>
          Occupation: Student</b></p>

          <p class="lead">Bryan is a student attending Rutgers University. He is a communications major and lives on campus. Although not involved with his major, Bryan is very computer savvy. In his free time he is always on the computer and knows how to use just about every component. Bryan has a new girlfriend, and she enjoys drinking wine when they go out. Bryan has a very slim knowledge of wine and usually just buys the bottle that is recommended to him at the store. His girlfriend does not always like the wine he buys and Bryan would like to be able to find wines that they can enjoy together.</p><hr class="featurette-divider">

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Scenarios<br/></h3>
          <p class="lead"><b>Scenario 1: Karen</b><br/>
          Once a month, Karen looks for a new case of wine to add to his wine cellar. She has many types of wine and wants to find one that she has not tried and does not have in her cellar. Most of her wines are from Napa Valley so she wants to figure a wine that is a good vintage, has a good rating, and is from Italy. She does not want to go to the store and look because they do not sell wine by the case. Karen wants to buy her wine online. With the new wine database, she can search for wines from Italy and find one that has a good rating and is from a year that she would like to have. Karen is not the best with computers but she types the keyword “italy” into the search query. Up pops a list of every wine from Italy, along with its vintage and rating. Karen then thinks further and decides that she wants an Italian wine from 2006 because it was a really good year for the grapes. She then types in “italy 2006”. Then a list of all the Italian wine from 2006 is at his fingertips. She goes through these and finds the perfect wine for her collection.</p>

          <p class="lead"><b>Scenario 2: Bryan</b><br/>
          Bryan is about to go out on a date with his girlfriend. Usually she does not ask him about the wine, but because the last one wasn’t so good, she asks him to make sure he finds a good one this time. Since Bryan doesn’t know much about wine, he refers to the database. Bryan does not know what type of wine he wants or what year is a good vintage. He decides to use the browsing technique. He knows his girlfriend likes Merlot, so he decides to go to the Merlots and browse through the different options. He browses through until he finds the one with the highest rating that is a fairly recent vintage.</p><hr class="featurette-divider">
        </div>


        <div class="col-md-12">
          <h3 class="featurette-heading">Persona and Scenario Rationale<br/></h3>
          <p class="lead">The persona of Bryan was created because the majority of wine drinkers seem to be casual occasion drinkers rather than someone who collects wine and is more serious about it. Bryan represents a population of young individuals who want to grab a good bottle of wine on their way out to dinner with a friend or spouse. Because this population of people are not wine experts, it is more likely that they would prefer to browse through the wines rather than search.</p>

          <p class="lead">On the other hand, Karen is somewhat of a wine expert. Her persona was created as somewhat of a secondary persona. Because the people we interviewed leaned towards the persona of Bryan, we had to represent the other side of the spectrum. Since Karen is very familiar with wine and knows what she wants, we found it more likely that she would search for the exact type of wine she is looking for, rather than browsing through everything.</p><hr class="featurette-divider">
